# Flock

This is a program that is simulating a flock of birds. Essentially, I've given two conditions, how far away the bird can be, and how close it can be. This program does use a lot of memory, so be warned. 

# Running Flock
I highly suggest that you clone and run this program. Alternatively, you can go here: laphatize.github.io/github/flock/flock.html

# Credit
I worked hard on this, please give credit if you use it.
